How do you quantify that?\n\n\n\nExercise 2.3  \n\nDeliveries - What Not to Do: Calibration Edition\nRe-predict the training set and use those values to estimate the calibration.\nIf you apply the calibration to the training set, what is the MAE?\nHow does that compare to the MAE values shown in the website’s analysis? Which do you think is correct and why?\n\n\n\nExercise 2.4  \n\nDeliveries - Tuning Cubist\nWe (arbitrarily) decided to use a 100-member ensemble in the materials.\nLike the neural network, try tuning the model across the ensemble size and determine if any size seems better than others (in terms of MAE).",
